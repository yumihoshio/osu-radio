[//]: # (You can remove the ${\textsf{\color{#f462a3}osu!}}$ if you just want it be osu!radio instead. That color can only work if there's spaces on both side)

# What is ${\textsf{\color{#f462a3}osu!}}$ radio
It's an application that play your ${\textsf{\color{#f462a3}osu!}}$ songs!

![Song Tab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da67b906-1429-4cc1-9087-76026e94b98a "The screen show a UI with all the buttons (Play, Pause, Forward and Rewind, as well as a Seek bar, with 4 songs on the left")

### Download Guide

> To use `git` and `npm`, you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) & [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed

`1` | Open the terminal in the directory you want to download osu!radio in. Then do the following command,
```
git clone https://github.com/Team-BTMC/osu-radio.git
```
> This command will create a copy of the github repositories in that directory

`2` | Then move into that directory with the following command,
```
cd .\osu-radio\
```

`3` | Next, do the following command to install the necessary files to run osu!radio
```
npm install
```

`4` | To start it up, simply fun the following command inside that osu!radio directory
```
npm run start
```

### Contribution
You can create a fork of the [main repositories](https://github.com/Team-BTMC/osu-radio) and do PR from there

# The Vision

Technologies:
- ${\textsf{\color{#9feaf9}Electron}}$
- ${\textsf{\color{#4c84c5}Solid JS}}$
- ${\textsf{\color{#3178c6}Typescript}}$

Staying on Electron because it's fine-ish for the time being.
<br>
The UI will stay web-based for ease of use & cost of being web-based :) I'd like to keep the UI the way it is.

If you want to make a change, feel free to suggest the change in PR or Discord DMs / tag me ( ${\textsf{\color{#f9c74f}@Dudu}}$ ) in [BTMC TALENT SERVER](https://discord.gg/mefjfMjV).
###### Animations are subject to change (the very few osu!radio has).
